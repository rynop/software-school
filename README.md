Teaching software and internet basics to kids. Targeted towards 8YO+

Throughout this project you'll see this:
> Help needed:

Which means I could use help from the community in the form of GitHub pull requests (PR) to make this project better.

Here is how it all started ;)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, there are some steps the teacher and each student will need to do.

> Help needed: this school is setup for mac and linux computers. PR welcome for adding windows support.

### Prereq's for teacher & each student

- Setup a place to collaborate (even if doing this in person). You'll need a place to share links (like VS Code "live share" extension, mentioned below). I recommend [guilded.gg](https://www.guilded.gg) (full transparency: this is where I work. `rynop/software-school` is no way affiliated).  Slack, MS Teams, etc will all work as well.  Here is my Guilded setup:

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).  You can use [my VS code preferences](./prereqs/vscode-prefs.json) if you like (⇧+⌘+P then `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`).
- Put `code` command on your path: ⇧+⌘+P then `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`
- Install VS code extensions via (make sure to restart your terminal after putting `code` on your PATH):
```
code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode
code --install-extension jgoday.createtmpfile
code --install-extension ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
```
- Clone this repo to `~/` (your home directory)
- [Install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/tr/download/package-manager)
- [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

### Prereq's for teacher

- Github account
- Slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZBV382xmKHYd6rEfKVmPTAwuuC0Ok2Nsl5CspRlGBlA/edit?usp=sharing) (bookmark it!)
- I recommend using VS Code ["Live share" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) to view/review/team code against student's VS Code IDE.  Set it up ahead of time (prereqs above already installed it for you), you will sign into the extension with your github account.  See the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/) for more info on how to use this extension.

### Prereq's for each student

- A student github account is not required, but there is a lesson at the end of this school that covers it. To get started quickly, open up VS Studio "Live share" extension, and login with your github account. If students have a github account, login with their credentials instead
